# Bluegenes

This library is meant to be an easy-to-use library for optimization using
genetic algorithms.

## Status

- [ ] Start
- [x] Models + tests
- [ ] Algorithms + tests
- [ ] Decent documentation

## Logic Overview

## Installation

## Usage

## Testing

To test, run the following:

```bash
python tests/test_genes.py
```

Note that the randomness may cause some tests to occasionally fail. I halved the
change of a random test failure every time one was encountered, but there are by
definition no guarantees of deterministic behavior when working with random
numbers. In other words, just run the test suite a few times. I'm aiming for <1%
change of a random test failure.
